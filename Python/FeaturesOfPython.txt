11. Extensible

Programming Environment
1. IDE --> Integrated development Environment for python
2. Installing of Anaconda Navigator (www.anaconda.com)
3. Google colaboratory

Topics of Python
1. Introduction of python
 Python is high level object oriented programming
2. Why Python?
    Easy syntax
    readability
    vast libraries .. ect
3. use case
    web development
    data science
    Automation
    AI & ML....etc
4. IDE --> Anaconda

2. Variables and data types
Variable:
    It is a container to store data in memory
    In py you don't need to declare the type of variable
    py dynamically typed
    variable name is case-sensitive
Data types:
    numeric --> int --> numbers
    boolean --> bool --> True, False
    Float --> float --> decimal
    character constant --> char --> alphabets
    String --> str
        str = ''   # single line string
        str1 = ""  # single line string
        str2 = '''
            multiline strings
        '''
    Array --> Collection of same data types it is index based
    List --> Collection of different data type is index based


3. Operators in Python
    Arithmetic operators --> (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
    Comparison Operators --> (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
    Logical Operators --> (and, or, not)
    Assignment Operator  --> (=, +=, -=, *=)
    Membership Operator --> (in, not in)
    Identity Operator --> (is, is not)

4. Control statement
    Conditional Statement (if, else, elif)
    loops
        for loop
        while loop
        Loop control statement (break, continue, pass)
            break --> The break Statement exit from loop premeturly
            continue --> The continue Statement is skip the current iteration and continue with next
            pass --> do nothing it is null operation
    nested loop --> loop inside loop

5. Data structures in python
    list --> List is ordered mutable collection of data, and it contains item of different datatypes
        syntax for list (empty list) --> list =[]
        create simple list and mixed list
        accessing the list using index --> list[1]
        Modifying the list --> list[1] = 100
        list methods --> append, insert, remove, pop, index, count, sort, reverse, clear
        slicing list --> creating sub list --> [3:5], [:5], [::2], [::-1]
        Iterating the list

    tuple --> tuple is ordered immutable collection of data
    set -->
    dictionaries
