Data Analysis with Python
    1. Numpy (Numerical python)
    2. Pandas ((Python data analysis library))
    3. Matplotlib (Data visualization)
    4. Seaborn (Data visualization)

1. Numpy is fundamental libraries for scientific computing in python it provide supports for array and matrices,
along with collection of mathematical function to operate on these data structure.
    1. install pip install numpy
    2. import numpy
    3. create array using numpy --> arr1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
    Common Numpy function
        np.array() --> create an array
        np.zeros(m, n) --> create an array with filled zeros
        np.one(m, n) --> create an array with filled one
        np.range(start, stop, step) --> Create an array with range of number
        np.mean(arr) --> take mean of all the elements in array
        np.std(arr) --> it will take standard division

2. Pandas (Python data analysis library)
    Panda is used to data manipulation and analysis. It provide data structured.
        1. Series (1D labeled array)
        2. DataFrame (2D table with labeled rows and columns)
    Key feature
        1. Handling and manipulation data from Excel, CSV, SQL, JSON,...etc
        2. Powerful indexing and data filtering
        3. Grouping, merging, and reshaping data
        4. Handling missing value

3. Matplotlib (Data visualization library in python)
    Matplotlib is powerful plotting library for python, that enable and create a static, animated and interactive
    visualization. it is widely used for visualization in data science and analytics. In this lesson we will
    cover basic Matplotlib, including creating various type of plot and customizing them.
